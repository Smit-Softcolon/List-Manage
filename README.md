## Functionality Requirements
Complete the app implementation to meet these requirements:
- When the application loads, it should display an empty list.
- The input field should access user text input.
- when the button is clicked:
    - The text from the input field should be added to the list.
    - The input field should be cleared.

Note: If input field is empty and the button is clicked, nothing should be added to the list.
